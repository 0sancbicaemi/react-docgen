The book claims to explain the philosophy of the subject which makes the understanding of the concepts very clear and makes the subject more interesting.
 
The book has received positive reviews from some readers who have praised its comprehensive approach, clear explanation, practical examples and useful diagrams. However, some readers have also pointed out some drawbacks of the book such as typos, errors, outdated information and lack of depth in some topics. Some readers have also suggested that the book could be improved by adding more exercises, numerical problems, case studies and references.
 
Overall, Transmission and Distribution by Uday A. Bakshi and Dr. Mayuresh V. Bakshi is a useful book for students who want to learn the basics of transmission and distribution in electrical engineering. It can also serve as a reference book for professionals who want to refresh their knowledge on the subject. However, the book may not be suitable for advanced learners who need more depth and detail on some topics.
 
The book is available as an eBook for $54.20 on Google Books[^1^] or as a PDF document on Scribd[^2^].
  
The book is divided into eight chapters, each covering a specific topic in transmission and distribution. The first chapter introduces the basics of power system such as generation, transmission, distribution, load flow and power system stability. The second chapter discusses the comparison of material required for overhead and underground systems such as conductors, cables, towers and poles. The third chapter explains the various types of d.c. and a.c. distribution systems such as radial, ring main, interconnected and meshed systems. The fourth chapter covers the EHVAC, HVDC and FACTS devices such as series and shunt compensation, static VAR compensator, static synchronous compensator and unified power flow controller. The fifth chapter deals with the sag calculation under different conditions such as level span, unequal supports, wind and ice loading and sag template. The sixth chapter provides an in depth analysis of transmission line parameters such as resistance, inductance and capacitance for single phase, three phase and bundled conductors. The seventh chapter covers the performance analysis of short, medium and long transmission lines along with circle diagram and methods of voltage control such as tap changing transformer, booster transformer and synchronous phase modifier. The eighth chapter explains the details of corona effect such as critical disruptive voltage, visual critical voltage, corona loss, factors affecting corona and methods of reducing corona.
 
The book also includes four appendices that provide additional information on transmission line constants, per unit system, symmetrical components and sequence networks. The book also contains question papers from previous examinations and a model paper for practice.
 
Transmission and Distribution by Uday A. Bakshi and Dr. Mayuresh V. Bakshi is a comprehensive book that covers all the essential topics in transmission and distribution for undergraduate courses in electrical engineering. It is also a valuable resource for professionals who want to update their knowledge on the subject.
