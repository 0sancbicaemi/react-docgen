# How to Install SM Bus Controller Drivers on Toshiba Satellite C850
 
If you have a Toshiba Satellite C850 laptop and you recently installed Windows 10 Home edition, you may notice that some devices are not recognized by the system. In particular, you may see an exclamation point for the SM Bus Controller or a PCI Simple Communications Controller under Other Devices in Device Manager. These devices are essential for low-speed system management communications and firmware interactions on your laptop.

To fix this issue, you need to download and install two drivers from Intel: the Chipset Device Software and the Intel Management Engine Consumer Driver. These drivers will enable Windows to properly recognize the SM Bus Controller and the PCI Simple Communications Controller. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the Chipset Device Software package from [this link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005621/software/chipset-software.html). This package will resolve the SMBus driver issue[^1^]. Extract this package to a temporary folder.
2. Open a Command Window and change directory to this temporary folder. Run the command ".\SetupChipset.exe /overall". Reboot your laptop.
3. Download and run the Intel Management Engine Consumer Driver package from [this link](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/26147). This package will resolve the PCI Simple Communications Controller issue[^2^]. Reboot your laptop.

After following these steps, you should see both devices working properly in Device Manager. You can now enjoy the full performance of your Toshiba Satellite C850 laptop.
  
What is an SM Bus Controller?
 
An SM Bus Controller is a device that is integrated into most Intel chipsets. It stands for System Management Bus and it is used for low-speed, system management communications between different components on the motherboard. For example, the SM Bus Controller can monitor the temperature, voltage, and fan speed of the CPU and other devices. It can also communicate with the BIOS and the operating system to provide system information and alerts.
 
What is a PCI Simple Communications Controller?
 
A PCI Simple Communications Controller is another name for the Intel Management Engine Interface (MEI). This device allows software running on the main processor to communicate with firmware running on the Intel Management Engine (ME). The ME is a separate processor that runs in parallel with the main processor and performs various tasks related to security, power management, and remote access. For example, the ME can enable features such as Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT).
  
Why do you need to install these drivers?
 
These drivers are necessary for Windows to properly recognize and communicate with the SM Bus Controller and the PCI Simple Communications Controller. Without these drivers, you may experience performance issues, system errors, or security vulnerabilities on your laptop. By installing these drivers, you can ensure that your laptop is running smoothly and securely.
