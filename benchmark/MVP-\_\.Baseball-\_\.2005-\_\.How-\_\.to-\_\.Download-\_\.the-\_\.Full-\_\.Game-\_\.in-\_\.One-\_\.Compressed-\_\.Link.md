## Step 4: Learn Some Tips and Tricks
  
MVP Baseball 2005 is not just a game of hitting and pitching. It also requires strategy, skill, and knowledge of the game. If you want to improve your performance and have more fun, you might want to learn some tips and tricks that can help you win more games. Here are some of them:
  
- Use the Full Swing Control to adjust your swing according to the pitch location and type. You can pull the ball, hit to the opposite field, try for a grounder, or go for a fly ball by using the left thumbstick[^2^]. Experiment with different swings and see what works best for you.
- Pay attention to the Pitcher/Batter Analysis screen before each at-bat. It shows you the pitcher's arsenal, stamina, confidence, and tendencies, as well as the batter's hot and cold zones, contact, power, and speed. Use this information to your advantage and plan your strategy accordingly.
- Don't swing at every pitch. Be patient and wait for your pitch. You can use the right thumbstick to guess the pitch location and type before it is thrown. If you guess correctly, you will get a slight boost in your swing. If you guess wrong, you will get a slight penalty. You can also use the R1 button to take a pitch if you are not sure.
- Use the Hitter's Eye feature to identify the pitch type by its color. A red pitch is a fastball, a green pitch is a changeup, a blue pitch is a curveball, and a yellow pitch is a slider. You can also see the break of the pitch by its trail. This can help you anticipate where the pitch will end up and adjust your swing accordingly.
- Use the right analog stick to influence your baserunners. You can make them advance, retreat, or slide by flicking the stick in different directions. You can also use the L1 button to make all your baserunners advance or retreat at once. Be careful not to run into outs or double plays.
- Use the Big Play Control to make spectacular defensive plays. You can dive, jump, or wall climb by using the right analog stick when fielding. You can also use it to make quick throws or cutoffs when throwing. Be aware of your fielder's ratings and abilities and don't try to do too much.
- Use the Dynasty Mode to create your own baseball empire. You can manage every aspect of your team, from signing players, trading players, scouting prospects, setting lineups, adjusting budgets, building stadiums, and more. You can also play through multiple seasons and try to win championships.
